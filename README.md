# Welcome
I hope you all enjoyed your presents this year. You may be confused at what the heck it is you got - and that is totally okay. Here is a list of what you *should* have received:

* [Raspberry Pi Zero WH](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi/products/raspberry-pi-zero-wh-with-pre-soldered-header) - The Computer!
* [16GB microSD Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RPVH4QQ/) preloaded with Raspian OS (it's like Windows or macOS)
* [Portable Wireless Mouse & Keyboard Combo](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Keyboard-Touchpad-Ergonomic-Rechargeable/dp/B07S74LB2K) - The Keyboard & Mouse
* [RPi Zero WH Essentials Kit](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-kits-and-bundles/products/raspberry-pi-zero-essential-kit) - 
* [RPi Zero WH Education #1 Kit](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-kits-and-bundles/products/camjam-edukit)
* Micro USB Power Cord

Let me know if you didn't receive all of these items! If you are bored already, skip below to the [Magic/Smart Mirror section]() to see how you can build something super cool with this... or just use it as a normal computer!

# What is this?
I'm going to steal from the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/) here:
> The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.

Essentially, it's just a really small computer! In order to use this thing you are going to need a few other items that will let you get everything set up. My goal for this present was to open quite a few different doors for you in the computer space. This doesn't mean you have to love computers or think you are going to be a computer scientist or engineer one day, but I hope it shows you what is possible with a few different demo options!

# Getting Set Up
Above this section, you figured out what the heck it is that Collin even got you as a present. If you have more questions, feel free to reach out. However, I want to set up the first basic arrangement so you can go from unboxing to browsing the internet. The rest of the fun and games will come.

## Additional Things you will need
1. HDMI cord: this should be plugged into any monitor or TV you use at home.
1. Power: I have included a micro USB to normal USB (type A) cord. This can be plugged into pretty much any USB port or wall charger and that will power the computer on. Note: this should be close to the HDMI/TV you plan on plugging into.
1. Hopefully the keyboard batteries are still charged, otherwise please charge those if they aren't working.

## Video Version
[Here is a video] that you can follow along with to get your computer up and running. I'm putting some timestamps below for the video as not all of the steps are required as I have already installed and updated the operating system (OS) for you. I will provide a more thorough walk through description as well.

* Start of video: introduction to the different parts and ports of the raspberry pi. This is a great introduction.
* Case: I don't suggest using a case for first getting started and ensuring everything is working.
* HDMI cord: You will need to plug the adapter into 
* At [2:00 there is a dongle for the keyboard] that will come from the wireless keyboard I included. it is in the back under the removable back with the battery.
* After plugging everything in, [skip to here](https://youtu.be/TUz2mVtJVsM?t=270) for getting things setup.

## Write-up Version
As I noted above, I almost provided everything you need to get this setup as a computer. I have already gone ahead and installed the Raspian OS onto the computer and installed the microSD card (the little card plugged into the side). Check out troubleshooting steps if it doesn't work right away. So all that is left to do is:

1. Plug in the display out via HDMI and the converter
1. Plug in the keyboard and mouse via the microUSB to normal USB extension or OTG cable. This goes into the left of the two ports.
1. Plug in power into the right of the two ports with the provided cable. I suggest plugging the power cable in after you have the monitor ready and keyboard installed.

Now it's time to boot everything up!
1. Once everything is connected, plug in the power. You should see a rainbow screen and then a lot of hacker-like code scroll through the screen like from [here in the video](https://youtu.be/TUz2mVtJVsM?t=270).
1. Login credentials: ` User: pi, Password: raspberry `
1. Please connect to your wifi and update your keyboard [as described here](https://youtu.be/TUz2mVtJVsM?t=345).

## Troubleshooting steps

### Keyboard isn't working
Try plugging the wireless keyboard into a normal computer and ensure it works there. Try plugging it back in after getting it to work there.

### I'm not sure if it powered on
The power button is a little weird on these. They will power on the second you put power to them. You should be able to tell by the little green and red LED lights on the board. 

### Display isn't showing up
Try plugging the TV/Monitor into your computer and make sure the input is switching correctly. Once you make sure the input is working, then plug it back into the Raspberry Pi.

### Any other issues?
Unplug and plug it back in. Sadly this fixes the majority of problems! Try to Google them! Lots of questions are answered online. However, feel free to ask me and we can figure out what is going on. Please try the troubleshooting steps above.


# Things you can build

## Circuit Board with the EduKit
The kit I included with your present has some great options to play around with the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins. If you have any interest in circuitry, this is a great place to start as it's always really fun to get a light to turn on all by yourself regardless of how old you are. I also understand this part can be pretty boring so I want to provide some examples below of cool projects that don't have to deal with circuits at all!

You can download the circuit board how-tos from [this website](https://camjam.me/?page_id=236) or I have attached them [here]().

## [Magic Mirror](https://magicmirror.builders/)
This is one of my build options for a smart mirror and is still on my list to do myself, but is a great example of community who has taken this device and made it into something that is very functional every single day!

Here are some example videos of people who have made them:
1. [Smart Mirror with LED Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkVBAcvbrjU)
1. [Smart Mirror that doesn't fog up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puFSdfIRNIw)
